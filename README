Dissertation Proposal

Notes:
Originally created in the MIT ML layout but it turned out to be too long so I changed it so it uses the ACM SIGCHI layout which made it three times smaller. If the MIT ML layout is needed the following needs to be executed.

For the MIT ML format use main.tex
For the ACM SIGCHI two-column format use acm-main.tex
