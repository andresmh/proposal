\chapter{Background}

I build on existing work that places remixing in new forms of cultural and economic production \citep{benkler_wealth_2006,jenkins_convergence_2006,manovich_remix_2005,sinnreich_ethics_2009}, and describes some challenges that remixing poses to our existing legal and moral assumptions \citep{lessig_remix:_2008, posner_little_2007}
Inspired by existing learning theories, for example \citet{lave_situated_1991}, I investigate remixing as a legitimate form of participation in a social learning environment.
Furthermore,  I build on the work that advocates remixing as a new media literacy skill \citep{ito_hanging_2010, jenkins_confronting_2009, livingstone_taking_2008, perkel_copy_2008}.
I look at the implications of remixing for the design of social computing systems by connecting to existing human-computer interaction research on systems for remixing and sharing videos \citep{diakopoulos_evolution_2007}, images \citep{seneviratne_policy-aware_2009}, music \citep{cheliotis_analysis_2009} and hypertext \citep{viegas_studying_2004}.
