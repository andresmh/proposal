In this paper we investigate the dynamics of Wikipedia, a prominent, thriving wiki. We make three contributions. First, we introduce a new exploratory data analysis tool, the history flow visualization, which is effective in revealing patterns within the wiki context and which we believe will be useful in other collaborative situations as well. Second, we discuss several collaboration patterns highlighted by this visualization tool and corroborate them with statistical analysis. Third, we discuss the implications of these patterns for the design and governance of online collaborative social spaces. We focus on the relevance of authorship, the value of community surveillance in ameliorating antisocial behavior, and how authors with competing perspectives negotiate their differences.},

The constructionist philosophy of education argues that learning through designing and constructing personally meaningful projects is better than learning by being told. Children on {MOOSE} Crossing learn computer programming and improve their reading and writing by working on self-selected projects in a self-motivated, peer-supported fashion. In experience with over 180 children and 90 adults using the system since October 1995, we have found that the community provides essential support for the children's learning experiences. The community provides role models; situated, ubiquitous project models; emotional support to overcome technophobia; technical support; and an appreciative audience for completed work. This paper examines the nature of that support in detail, and argues that community support for learning is an essential element in collaborative work and learning on the Internet.},

This article explores teenagers' practices of social networking in order to uncover the subtle connections between online opportunity and risk. While younger teenagers relish the opportunities to recreate continuously a highly-decorated, stylistically-elaborate identity, older teenagers favour a plain aesthetic that foregrounds their links to others, thus expressing a notion of identity lived through authentic relationships. The article further contrasts teenagers' graded conception of `friends' with the binary classification of social networking sites, this being one of several means by which online privacy is shaped and undermined by the affordances of these sites.},

We present a qualitative case study of an online video remixing site, illustrating how the constraints of that environment are impacting authorial constructs. We discuss users' self-conceptions as authors, and how values related to authorship are reflected to users through the interface and design of the site's tools.

can be very easily aggregated, mashed up and presented in other Web pages. Content generation of this nature inevitably leads
to many copyright and license violations, motivating research into effective methods to detect and prevent such violations.

This is supported by an experiment on Creative Commons {(CC)} attribution license violations from samples of Web pages that
had at least one embedded Flickr image, which revealed that the attribution license violation rate of Flickr images on the
Web is around 70-90\%. Our primary objective is to enable users to do the right thing and comply with {CC} licenses associated
with Web media, instead of preventing them from doing the wrong thing or detecting violations of these licenses. As a solution,
we have implemented two applications: (1) Attribution License Violations Validator, which can be used to validate users{\textquoteright} derived
work against attribution licenses of reused media and, (2) Semantic Clipboard, which provides license awareness of Web media
and enables users to copy them along with the appropriate license metadata.},

Yet they coexist with, and outperform, price-based and government-funded systems that offer substitutable functionality. This essay seeks to do two things. The first three parts are dedicated to defining a particular class of physical goods as "shareable goods" that systematically have excess capacity, and to combining comparative transaction costs and motivation analysis to suggest that this excess capacity may better be harnessed through sharing relations than through secondary markets. The fourth part is then dedicated to explaining how the observation about shareable goods in the domain of physical goods meshes with the literature on social norms, social capital, and common property regimes, as well as with work on peer production. It suggests that social sharing and exchange is an underappreciated modality of economic production, alongside price-based and firm-based market production and state-based production, whose salience in the economy is sensitive to technological conditions. The last part explores how the recognition of shareable goods and sharing as a modality of economic production can inform policy.}

the new media literacies: a set of cultural competencies and social skills that young people need
in the new media landscape. Participatory culture shifts the focus of literacy from one of individual
expression to community {involvement.The} new literacies almost all involve social skills
developed through collaboration and {networking.These} skills build on the foundation of traditional

However, because of the coordination needed to write an article collaboratively, adding contributors is costly. We examined how the number of editors in Wikipedia and the coordination methods they use affect article quality. We distinguish between explicit coordination, in which editors plan the article through communication, and implicit coordination, in which a subset of editors structure the work by doing the majority of it. Adding more editors to an article improved article quality only when they used appropriate coordination techniques and was harmful when they did not. Implicit coordination through concentrating the work was more helpful when many editors contributed, but explicit coordination through communication was not. Both types of coordination improved quality more when an article was in a formative stage. These results demonstrate the critical importance of coordination in effectively harnessing the "wisdom of the crowd" in online production environments.},

In this paper we share the results of an exploratory study of active web users, their perceptions of what mashups could do for them and how they might be created. These users engage in many Internet-based activities but not web programming. Our results show that the technology initiative present in these users is a predictor of the value they see in mashups and the types of mashups they are interested in creating. While they may lack the programming skills, the users do see benefit in the use and creation of mashups as a tool for sharing and integrating information, as well as a means of effectively searching for information.},

Remixes were often complex, using many short segments taken from various source media. Reuse of spoken and written language in source media, and the use of written language in user-defined overlay text segments proved to be essential for most users. We describe how community remix statistics can be leveraged for media summarization, browsing, and editing support. Further, the platform as a whole provides a solid base for a range of ongoing research into community annotation and remix including analysis of remix syntax, identification of reusable segments, media and segment tagging, structured annotation of media, collaborative media production, and hybrid content-based and community-in-the-loop approaches to understanding media semantics.},

It analyses the political economy of Pok\'{e}mon, and its attempts to appeal to different sub-sections of the children's market; the textual appeals of the different Pok\'{e}mon artefacts, and the role of `knowledge'; and debates about the positive and negative consequences for child consumers. In the process, the article explores the notion of `pedagogy' as an alternative means of understanding the relations between structure and agency, and assesses its possibilities and limitations in the context of the case study.},

We also provide a normative perspective on the strategies that such communities should employ with respect to the use of 'remixing contests', which are popular means of attracting new user-creators to the community and boosting its creative output. Until now research has shied away from the quantitative study of what lies at the heart of this 'remix culture', i.e. remixing, presumably because of the difficulties inherent in attaining relevant large datasets amenable to numerical analysis and an early focus of research efforts on communities whose products serve a more functional purpose (e.g., open source software), rather than aiming at entertainment or personal and artistic expression. This paper contributes to the literature of social network analysis of online communities, the literature on commons-based peer production, and the research agenda of cultural analytics.},

	abstract = {For decades our common understanding of the organization of economic production has been that individuals order their productive activities in one of two ways: either as employees in firms, following the directions of managers, or as individuals in markets, following price signals. This dichotomy was first identified in the early work of Ronald Coase and was developed most explicitly in the work of institutional economist Oliver Williamson. Recently, public attention has focused on a fifteen-year-old phenomenon called free software or open source software. This phenomenon involves thousands, or even tens of thousands, of computer programmers who collaborate on large- and small-scale projects without traditional firm-based or market-based ownership of the resulting product. This Article explains why free software is only one example of a much broader social-economic phenomenon emerging in the digitally networked environment, a third mode of production that the author calls "commons-based peer production."

The Article begins by demonstrating the widespread use of commons-based peer production on the Internet through a number of detailed examples, such as Wikipedia, Slashdot, the Open Directory Project, and Google. The Article uses these examples to reveal fundamental characteristics of commons-based peer production that distinguish it from the property- and contract-based modes of firms and markets. The central distinguishing characteristic is that groups of individuals successfully collaborate on large-scale projects following a diverse cluster of motivational drives and social signals rather than market prices or managerial commands. The Article then explains why this mode has systematic advantages over markets and managerial hierarchies in the digitally networked environment when the object of production is information or culture. First, peer production has an advantage in what the author calls "information opportunity cost," because it loses less information about who might be the best person for a given job. Second, there are substantial increasing allocation gains to be captured from allowing large clusters of potential contributors to interact with large clusters of information resources in search of new projects and opportunities for collaboration. The Article concludes with an overview of how these models use a variety of technological, social, and formal strategies to overcome the collective action problems usually solved in managerial and market-based systems by property, contract, and managerial commands.},

In particular, we analyzed the ways in which microblogging, social network, video, photo, music and scientific data sharing websites support some the following forms of content reuse: (a) Licensed content brought in from external sources. (b) Content uploaded to the website and given a license of the user's liking. (c) Licensed content from the website reused elsewhere. (d) Licensed content reused within the website. We found that the majority of the websites we analyzed had insufficient support for these different types of content reuse scenarios, acting merely as content distribution portals rather than platforms that support a culture of remixing. Some of the websites were found to have support for different licenses but most websites lack adequate functionality for finding licensed content, remixing and attributing sources for remixes.},

environment that fosters the development of new literacies.
This analysis is based on a model that tries to reconcile
social and technical perspectives on literacy. The
expressive power found in the creation of a {MySpace} profile
concerns a technically simple but socially complex practice:
the copying and pasting of code as a way to appropriate and
reuse other people{\textquoteright}s media products. However, the
importance of copying and pasting code does not easily fit
in the common conventions of reading and writing,
consumption and production. By integrating theories of
appropriation and reuse of media with theories of literacy,
a new way of thinking about this practice emerges, seeing
{\textquotedblleft}participation {\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}remix {\textquotedblright} as important concepts
to describe the social and technical aspects of new media
literacy.},

We describe Chickenfoot, a programming system embedded in the Firefox web browser, which enables end-users to automate, customize, and integrate web applications without examining their source code. One way Chickenfoot addresses this goal is a novel technique for identifying page components by keyword pattern matching. We motivate this technique by studying how users name web page components, and present a heuristic keyword matching algorithm that identifies the desired component from the user's name.},

Success is based not only on what one knows or how much one knows, but on one's ability to think and act creatively. In short, people are now living in the Creative Society. Unfortunately, few of today's classrooms focus on helping students develop as creative thinkers. In addition, the proliferation of new technologies is quickening the pace of change, accentuating the need for creative thinking in all aspects of people's lives. In this article, the author discusses two technologies developed by his research group at the {MIT} Media Lab with the explicit goal of helping people develop as creative thinkers. The two technologies, called Crickets and Scratch, are designed to support what the author calls the "creative thinking spiral." In this process, people "imagine" what they want to do, "create" a project based on their ideas, "play" with their creations, "share" their ideas and creations with others, and "reflect" on their experiences--all of which leads them to "imagine" new ideas and new projects. {(Contains} 3 online resources.){\textless}/p{\textgreater}}

Is there a connection between plagiarism complaints and similarities between a remix and the work it is based on? Our findings indicate that users have a very wide range of reactions to remixing and that as many users react positively as accuse remixers of plagiarism.

the high number of plagiarism accusations related to original project complexity, cumulative remixing, originators{\textquoteright} integration into remixing practice, and remixee-remixer project similarity, and find support for the first and last explanations.},

The Revision Control System {(RCS)} is a software tool that assists with that task. {RCS} manages revisions of text documents, in particular source programs, documentation, and test data. It automates the storing, retrieval, logging and identification of revisions, and it provides selection mechanisms for composing configurations. This paper introduces basic version control concepts and discusses the practice of version control using {RCS.} For conserving space, {RCS} stores deltas, i.e. differences between successive revisions. Several delta storage methods are discussed. Usage statistics show that {RCS's} delta method is space and time efficient. The paper concludes with a detailed survey of version control tools.},
