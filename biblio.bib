In this paper we investigate the dynamics of Wikipedia, a prominent, thriving wiki. We make three contributions. First, we introduce a new exploratory data analysis tool, the history flow visualization, which is effective in revealing patterns within the wiki context and which we believe will be useful in other collaborative situations as well. Second, we discuss several collaboration patterns highlighted by this visualization tool and corroborate them with statistical analysis. Third, we discuss the implications of these patterns for the design and governance of online collaborative social spaces. We focus on the relevance of authorship, the value of community surveillance in ameliorating antisocial behavior, and how authors with competing perspectives negotiate their differences.},

This article explores teenagers' practices of social networking in order to uncover the subtle connections between online opportunity and risk. While younger teenagers relish the opportunities to recreate continuously a highly-decorated, stylistically-elaborate identity, older teenagers favour a plain aesthetic that foregrounds their links to others, thus expressing a notion of identity lived through authentic relationships. The article further contrasts teenagers' graded conception of `friends' with the binary classification of social networking sites, this being one of several means by which online privacy is shaped and undermined by the affordances of these sites.},

We present a qualitative case study of an online video remixing site, illustrating how the constraints of that environment are impacting authorial constructs. We discuss users' self-conceptions as authors, and how values related to authorship are reflected to users through the interface and design of the site's tools.

to many copyright and license violations, motivating research into effective methods to detect and prevent such violations.

This is supported by an experiment on Creative Commons {(CC)} attribution license violations from samples of Web pages that
had at least one embedded Flickr image, which revealed that the attribution license violation rate of Flickr images on the
Web is around 70-90\%. Our primary objective is to enable users to do the right thing and comply with {CC} licenses associated
with Web media, instead of preventing them from doing the wrong thing or detecting violations of these licenses. As a solution,
we have implemented two applications: (1) Attribution License Violations Validator, which can be used to validate users{\textquoteright} derived
work against attribution licenses of reused media and, (2) Semantic Clipboard, which provides license awareness of Web media
and enables users to copy them along with the appropriate license metadata.},

for change is currently found in afterschool programs and informal learning communities.
Schools and afterschool programs must devote more attention to fostering what we call
the new media literacies: a set of cultural competencies and social skills that young people need
in the new media landscape. Participatory culture shifts the focus of literacy from one of individual
expression to community {involvement.The} new literacies almost all involve social skills
developed through collaboration and {networking.These} skills build on the foundation of traditional

We also provide a normative perspective on the strategies that such communities should employ with respect to the use of 'remixing contests', which are popular means of attracting new user-creators to the community and boosting its creative output. Until now research has shied away from the quantitative study of what lies at the heart of this 'remix culture', i.e. remixing, presumably because of the difficulties inherent in attaining relevant large datasets amenable to numerical analysis and an early focus of research efforts on communities whose products serve a more functional purpose (e.g., open source software), rather than aiming at entertainment or personal and artistic expression. This paper contributes to the literature of social network analysis of online communities, the literature on commons-based peer production, and the research agenda of cultural analytics.},

	abstract = {For decades our common understanding of the organization of economic production has been that individuals order their productive activities in one of two ways: either as employees in firms, following the directions of managers, or as individuals in markets, following price signals. This dichotomy was first identified in the early work of Ronald Coase and was developed most explicitly in the work of institutional economist Oliver Williamson. Recently, public attention has focused on a fifteen-year-old phenomenon called free software or open source software. This phenomenon involves thousands, or even tens of thousands, of computer programmers who collaborate on large- and small-scale projects without traditional firm-based or market-based ownership of the resulting product. This Article explains why free software is only one example of a much broader social-economic phenomenon emerging in the digitally networked environment, a third mode of production that the author calls "commons-based peer production."

The Article begins by demonstrating the widespread use of commons-based peer production on the Internet through a number of detailed examples, such as Wikipedia, Slashdot, the Open Directory Project, and Google. The Article uses these examples to reveal fundamental characteristics of commons-based peer production that distinguish it from the property- and contract-based modes of firms and markets. The central distinguishing characteristic is that groups of individuals successfully collaborate on large-scale projects following a diverse cluster of motivational drives and social signals rather than market prices or managerial commands. The Article then explains why this mode has systematic advantages over markets and managerial hierarchies in the digitally networked environment when the object of production is information or culture. First, peer production has an advantage in what the author calls "information opportunity cost," because it loses less information about who might be the best person for a given job. Second, there are substantial increasing allocation gains to be captured from allowing large clusters of potential contributors to interact with large clusters of information resources in search of new projects and opportunities for collaboration. The Article concludes with an overview of how these models use a variety of technological, social, and formal strategies to overcome the collective action problems usually solved in managerial and market-based systems by property, contract, and managerial commands.},

environment that fosters the development of new literacies.
This analysis is based on a model that tries to reconcile
social and technical perspectives on literacy. The
expressive power found in the creation of a {MySpace} profile
concerns a technically simple but socially complex practice:
the copying and pasting of code as a way to appropriate and
reuse other people{\textquoteright}s media products. However, the
importance of copying and pasting code does not easily fit
in the common conventions of reading and writing,
consumption and production. By integrating theories of
appropriation and reuse of media with theories of literacy,
a new way of thinking about this practice emerges, seeing
{\textquotedblleft}participation {\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}remix {\textquotedblright} as important concepts
to describe the social and technical aspects of new media
