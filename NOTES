* Connect to Cultural Analytics? 
* Manovich's work
* Remixing across countries
* Terms used by people to talk negatively about remixing: spoof, copy, plagirism, copycat

Audience feedback:

* Add reference to Papert's samba school.
* Provide explicit definition of credit vs attribution
* Scratch Resource and Mods are out of scope
* Functional could be categorized into themes, e.g. creation, participation (in contests, chains), collaboration and perhaps it's related to group 
* Component-size axis should go from small to big, not the other way around.
* Is there value in Scratch copying?
* Word decomposability has negative connotations. What about separability?

Committee discussion:
Mitch:
* Write for a month and see what's missing.
* Decide whether to focus on the phenomena on the margins vs the core. What is Scratch well situated to answer? Lack of generalization of Sratch Resources or Clutter?
* Identify trajectories

Yochai:
* Division of labor and mutual dependence VS sequential contributions (does not require cooperation) 
* Identify 2 kids of collaborations: coordination, division of labor, mutual depenendency and iteration over fine contributions (e.g Wikipedia). Remixing is closer to this.
* Conceptual framework is catching too much. Put boundaries on remixing.  Self-remixing, not really remixing. 
* Not only how people find objects but also how do they find collaborators? What are the motivations?

Rob:
* The term remix evokes culture, the term reuse evokes software.
* Self-remixing is a deceiving term, perhaps use self-reuse.
* Questions are similar to SW engineering.
* Look at people: how does their remixing behavior changes over time? How do critical incidents affect participants? Do they leave? Developmental trajectories?
* How can we capture more granular remixing? How much are we losing from coarseness (since we only look at project-level)? Maybe triangulate.
* How do people find what they want to remix? (common problem in software companies)
