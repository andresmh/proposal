I propose a framework to examine remixing in an online community of amateur creators. I focus on the functional, structural and attitudinal characteristics of an online community's sociotechnical infrastructure and its participants activities.
This framework derives from and is examined through design interventions, three-years of participant observation data, case studies, interviews with community members, quantitative and network analysis of a large corpus of data that includes more than 700,000 registered accounts and a repository of more than 9 million comments and 1.6 million interactive media objects, 30\% of which are remixes.
