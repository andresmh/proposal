I analyze the role remixing plays in participating in an online community of creators.
I look at how several forms of remixing are represented in the Scratch Online Community, how their use evolves, and how they do or do not support sociability and creative practices.
I analyze people's remixing behavior including their: 
1) adding to existing work, 
2) reusing components, 
3) collaborating with others in groups, 
4) persuading crowds to join remixing chains, 
5) inspiring others with ideas for new creations or 
6) self-appropriating their work to create something.
